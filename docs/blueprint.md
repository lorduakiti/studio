# **App Name**: Synaptic Canvas

## Core Features:

- WebGL Initialization: Initialize a WebGL context and set up the basic scene.
- Network Definition: Define the structure of the neural network (layers, nodes, connections) as data.
- 3D Object Generation: Create 3D representations of nodes and connections using WebGL primitives.
- Animation Loop: Animate the network, possibly simulating signal propagation, node activation, or weight changes.
- User Controls: Allow users to control the animation (pause, play, adjust speed, rotate the view).

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a dark background (#121212) to make the animation stand out.
- Use a gradient color scheme for nodes to indicate activation levels (e.g., blue to green to yellow to red).
- Use a contrasting color for connections to make them visible against the background.
- Accent: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Use clear, sans-serif fonts for any labels or UI elements.
- Use simple, geometric icons for control buttons (play, pause, reset).
- Center the WebGL canvas on the page with controls positioned below.
- Use smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance the visual appeal.
